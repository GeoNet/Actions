# Actions

> reusable GitHub actions across several projects

This repo is for reusable workflows to run in GitHub Actions for the GeoNet program.
The workflows are not publicly supported and come with absolutely no warranty.

## Workflows

There are three types of workflows in this repo

- reusable: GeoNet downstream implementations of existing actions or common patterns
- reusable _apps_: combined function workflows which include several other reusable workflows
- GeoNet/Actions maintainability: workflows which support the consistency of the workflows in this repo

the workflows are intended to work with and around the maintainers of GeoNet software for automations which are valuable to the project.

### <NAME>

STATUS: <deprecated|alpha|beta|stable>

<DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE>

Example:

\```yaml
name: build

on:
  push: {}
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  packages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-WORKFLOW-FILE-NAME.yml@main
    # with:
    #   KEY: VALUE
\```

<ADDITIONAL INFORMATION>
<ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL CONFIG EXAMPLE>

for configuration see [`on.workflow_call.inputs` in .github/workflows/reusable-WORKFLOW-FILE-NAME.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-WORKFLOW-FILE-NAME.yml).

-->

### Ko build

STATUS: stable

Generic build for containerised Go applications with [Ko](https://ko.build).

Example:

```yaml
name: build

on:
  push: {}
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  packages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-ko-build.yml@main
    # with:
    #   paths: ./cmd/coolapp
    #   registryOverride: registry.example.com
    #   registryGhcrUsernameOverride: ${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}
    #   registryGhcrPasswordOverride: ${{ secrets.GHCR_PASSWORD }}
    #   push: true
    #   aws-region: ap-southeast-2
    #   aws-role-arn-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/github-actions-ROLE_NAME
    #   aws-role-duration-seconds: "3600"
    #   setup: |
    #     sudo apt install -y something-needed-for-build
    #   configPath: .ko.yaml
```

- dynamic build of images based on entrypoints (where there is a `package main`), unless if _inputs.paths_ is set
- fast!

Pushing to ECR example:

```yaml
name: build

on:
  push: {}
  release:
    types: [published]
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  packages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-ko-build.yml@main
    with:
      registryOverride: $ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com
      aws-region: ap-southeast-2
      aws-role-arn-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::$ACCOUNT:role/$ROLE_NAME
      aws-role-duration-seconds: "3600"
```

for configuration see [`on.workflow_call.inputs` in .github/workflows/reusable-ko-build.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-ko-build.yml).

### Docker build

STATUS: stable

for configuration see [`on.workflow_call.inputs` in .github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yml).

### Dockerfile lint

STATUS: stable

```yaml
name: dockerfile lint
on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  dockerfile-lint:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-dockerfile-lint.yml@main
    with:
    #   dockerfiles: |
    #     ...
```

### Container image scan

STATUS: stable

Scan a (set of) container image(s) and upload the results to GitHub's Security code scanning center

Basic usage (non-integrated):

```yaml
name: scan

on:
  push: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-container-image-scan.yml@main
    with:
      imageRefs: alpine:3.17,postgres:15
```

`inputs.imageRefs` is a comma separated list of container image refs.

### Terraform management

STATUS: stable

Trigger a `terraform plan` (and optionally `terraform apply`) against Terraform located in the repo, starting at the repo root

Example:

```yaml
name: terraform

on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  terraform:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-terraform-management.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    # with:
    #   allowApply: true
```

for Terraform Cloud, set `TF_API_TOKEN` in the repo's Actions Secrets

for configuration see [`on.workflow_call.inputs` in .github/workflows/reusable-terraform-management.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-terraform-management.yml).

### Presubmit Actions workflow require commit digest vet

STATUS: stable

Require Actions to use external actions by their commit digest on presubmit pull requests

```yaml
name: Presubmit Actions workflow require commit digest vet

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  presubmit-workflow:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-presubmit-actions-workflow-require-commit-digest-vet.yml@main
```

### Presubmit Go code lint

STATUS: stable

Require pull requests for Go projects to have no linting errors

```yaml
name: Presubmit golangci lint
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
      - canon
  pull_request: {}
jobs:
  golangci:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-golangci-lint.yml@main
    # with:
    #   config: |
    #     linters:
    #       enable:
    #         - gosec
    #         - funlen
    #         - depguard
    #         - whitespace
```

Standard `golangci-lint` config comes from the _.golangc-lint.yml_ file, which is located at the root of a repo and is pulled in with this action.
Whilst not generally recommend, this config can be override per action use, with the `config` input.

for configuration see [`on.workflow_call.inputs` in .github/workflows/reusable-golangci-lint.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-golangci-lint.yml).

jobs:
  govulncheck:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-govulncheck.yml@main
```

```yaml
name: policy conformance
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
permissions:
  statuses: write
  checks: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  conform:
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-policy-conformance.yml@main
```

each repo where this action is applied must contain a `.conform.yaml` in the root of the repo.
Conform configuration examples:

- <https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/blob/main/.conform.yaml>
- <https://github.com/siderolabs/conform/blob/main/.conform.yaml>
- <https://github.com/BobyMCbobs/sample-ko-monorepo/blob/main/.conform.yaml>

here's an in-line example

```yaml
policies:
- type: commit
  spec:
    dco: true
    gpg:
      required: true
      githubOrganization: GeoNet
    spellcheck:
      locale: US
    maximumOfOneCommit: true
    header:
      length: 89
      imperative: true
      case: lower
      invalidLastCharacters: .
    body:
      required: true
    conventional:
      types:
        - chore
        - docs
        - perf
        - refactor
        - style
        - test
        - release
      scopes: [".*"]
```

common useful types of requirements:

- commit signed
- single commit
- commit contains body

notes:

- the conventional types include the following types by default and are not needed to be specified
  - _feat_
  - _fix_

GitHub Actions artifacts are used to bring state between jobs, this is not possible in any other known way.

### Clean container versions

STATUS: stable

```yaml
name: clean-images
permissions:
  packages: write
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '30 11,23 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  clean:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-clean-containers.yml@main
    with:
      package-name: base-images/fedora
      ignored-regex: '(stable)|(38)'
      number-kept: 7
```

## Composite Actions

### Tagging

STATUS: stable

Generic container tagging.

Generally will be used in the reusable workflows, but if one needed to use the action directly:

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      tag: steps.tagging.outputs.tag
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - id: tagging
        uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/actions/tagging@main
  build:
    needs: prepare
    uses: GeoNet/Actions/.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yml@main
    with:
      tag: ${{ needs.prepare.outputs.tag }}
```

## Other documentation

### Dependabot and Actions workflow imports

Dependabot is enabled for this repo, see the config in [.github/dependabot.yml](./.github/dependabot.yml).
It will automatically update create PRs to update the Actions workflow imports once a week in a seemingly staggered way.

To force an update of every external import, run `hack/update-actions-imports.sh` and commit the changes in a new PR.

### Versioning for container images

Container registries utilise content addressed storage, meaning to get some data (blob, image), you must request what it's digest is (the process behind tags).
When pushing images using the reusable Docker or Ko builds, the images will always be tagged as latest or their digest.
In order to precisely tag a container image, use the image promotion action.

The digests for images are able to be found with:

```shell
crane digest IMAGE_REF
```

or in the logs of the workflow run.
